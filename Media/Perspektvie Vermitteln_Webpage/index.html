        <h2>Our HCI-Project</h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        In the context of a HCI project work for our studies, we examined three distinct methods to convey perspective in a multiplayer virtual reality environment and compared them with each other. The core idea is to enhance the field of view of a player, at a particular position, with visual cues from a partner at a different position. The additional information enables the player to perform an otherwise hard to complete task. Derived from this our suggested methods are Object-Highlighting, a Visual-Cone and Picture-In-Picture (live broadcast view of partner to player). We conducted an experiment to assess differences, regarding precision, performance and ease of adaption after failure as well as VR sickness, in an interactive interdependent multiplayer task. Following our results, Object-Highlighting was the inferior of all techniques, as adjustments after mistakes within the task were significantly harder in comparison.

        <ul>
            <li>Object-Highlighting: The object of interest is being highlighted by a player (e.g. with an salient color) and is clearly visible even through other objects that might be in front of it. Now all players which have the object of interest in their field of view can see that it is highlighted.</li>
            <li>Picture-In-Picture: The entire FoV of a particular player is being broadcast live on a surface or an area (often down-scaled, monitor size). Now all other players which have this surface or area in their FoV can see exactly what that player sees.</li>
            <li>Visual-Cone (henceforth: Other players can see the head of a certain player represented as a visual cone (not necessarily a cone, every object which is suitable to visualize the line of sight is conceivable). The cone moves synchronously on all axes with the head movement of that player and clarifies his line of sight by the direction in which its open end points.</li>
